# Lab Instructions for React form validation

## Implement State for Form Fields

- password
- confirmPassword

## Write validation functions or inline logic for

- Username: Must be at least 3 characters.
- Password: Must be at least 8 characters.
- Confirm Password: Must match the password field.

## Display Error Messages

- Create state variables for each field's error message (e.g., usernameError, passwordError).
- Use conditional rendering to display the appropriate error message under each field.

## Disable the Submit Button

- Use the disabled attribute on the submit button.
- Ensure the button is disabled if any field is invalid.

## Handle Form Submission

- Log the user data to the console or display it on the page for testing.
